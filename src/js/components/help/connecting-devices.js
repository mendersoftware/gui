	         If a client and server have not exchanged any information in advance, they need to accept each other on trust this first time, 
	         with the risk that the information the other party presents is spoofed. To mitigate this risk, the Mender client preinstalls 
	         the TLS certificate of the server when it is provisioned, as part of the Yocto Project image build. So it is not possible for 
	         a rogue server to intercept the connection from a client or pretend to be a different server, assuming server's private TLS key 
	         is securely managed. A rogue device can still spoof the information it sends to the server in order to be authorized, and this 
	         is why Mender asks you to make the authorization decision. However, the risk of letting the server manage a rogue device is much 
	         lower than the risk of a rogue server managing devices.</p>
