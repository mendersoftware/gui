# Mender: GUI

Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded Linux
devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as well as
a server that manages deployments across many devices.

This repository contains the Mender Graphical User Interface, which is part of the
Mender server. The Mender server is designed as a microservices architecture
and comprises several repositories.

The GUI exposes the entirety of Mender's functionality to the user, including
deployment definition, scheduling and monitoring, device listing and admission, etc.

## Getting started

To start using Mender, we recommend that you begin with the Getting started
section in [the Mender documentation](https://docs.mender.io/).

## Contributing

We welcome and ask for your contribution. If you would like to contribute to Mender, please read our guide on how to best get started [contributing code or
documentation](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development

In order to develop the GUI code to contribute, it is required to [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli) installed, followed
by an execution of `npm install` to install all the dependencies in package.json. Work on the files in 'src'. Running `npm run watch` will watch for your
changes as you develop and build as you go.
The `watch` command is intended to build however the content should be served from within the regular container running in your local mender setup.
To connect the two a typical approach is to create a `docker-compose.override.yml` in the folder you have cloned the integration repo into (to isolate the changes made to the running environment in a single file) with the following content:

```
version: '2.1'
services:
    mender-gui:
        volumes:
            - ../<path-to-clone-of-the-gui-repo>/dist:/var/www/mender-gui/dist
```

and then start the demo environment with this file like this: `./demo -f docker-compose.override.yml up` from the integration clone folder. The content should be accessible under https://localhost/ just as without any modifications. While running `npm run watch` the results of each incremental build should show up on page refresh.
To ensure committed changes pass the CI pipeline it is good to run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` before you submit your changes for review.

The project is equipped with commit checks powered by [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) that check for linter problems and run tests on the changed files. To also check your commit messages and fix potential problems with them, make sure to set `MENDER_TESTING` in your `ENV` to a local clone of the [mendertesting](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mendertesting) repository.
